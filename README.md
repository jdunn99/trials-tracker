# Trials Tracker

Trials Tracker is a data visualization web application for Destiny 2's Trials of Osiris game mode.
Trials of Osiris is a competitive Player vs Player (PVP) gamemode where players compete in a series of 3v3 matches, with a goal of achieving 7 wins in a row.

Having recently been updated in Destiny 2, Trials of Osiris has seen a [massive](https://twitter.com/TrialsReport/status/1478427778722766848) increase in players and is one of the most popular modes in Destiny 2.

Data for this app is received from the bungie.net official [API](https://bungie-net.github.io/), and is processed with Next JS Api routes (originally used an Express server but for hosting purposes switched to Next API)

The front-end is built using NextJS and contains 3 pages of information.
A page for viewing a Destiny 2 user's Trials of Osirsis statistics, a page for their match history across all characters,
and a page to check their guadian's loadouts
